# Block and Inline Elements

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
The two most common display values are block and inline.

## Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: `<p>` and `<div>`.
The `<p>` element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The `<div>` element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

## Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a `<span>` element inside a paragraph.

### The div Element

The `<div>` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The `<div>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

### The span Element

The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The `<span>` element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

## HTML class Attribute

The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

## HTML id Attribute

The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
